This document is the single source for the homepage and article page components: their names, parts, variants, sizes per width, content rules, accessibility and checks. It is for designers, developers and AI agents.

The component values use the tokens of `color-system.md`, `typography-system.md` and `spacing-layout-system.md`, plus the component tokens in Section 6. The section layouts (wrapper, rail, columns per width) are in `spacing-layout-system.md` Section 7.

This file is the only home of the component specs (DR-372, DR-377). To change it, write the change in the page spec log (`docs/spec-log/<page>.md`); at the final checkpoint the coding agent writes the green items into this file on the page branch, so they go in the same pull request (DR-392).

## 1. How to use this document

- Find the component for a homepage part in the **name table** (Section 3). Use these names in code, tests, briefs and chat (`N-05`).
- Follow the **rules** (Section 4). Each rule has a stable ID, for example `CPT-05`. Use the ID in reviews, prompts and commit messages.
- Build each component from its **sheet** (Section 7). The sheet gives the parts, the values per width and the checks.
- Values in the sheets are the result. Build them with the tokens and the Tailwind 4px scale classes. Do not type a hex value or an arbitrary size in a component (`CPT-07`). A value that only one component uses is a scale class in that component, for example `min-h-13` for a 52px row (`LAY-21`). Add a component token in `src/styles/components.css` only for a value that two or more components share or that is not a scale step.
- "Phone" is a page under 600px, "tablet" is 600 to 1023px and "desktop" is 1024px and up, unless a sheet gives other widths.

## 4. Rules

### CPT-01 Name a component by what it is

Name components by what they are, not by where they sit. Use StoryCard, not HeroRightCard. Bangla section names are content, never component names. (DR-84)

### CPT-02 Give a variant as a prop

Give a variant as a prop with a closed list of values, for example variant="overlap" | "plain". Do not make a new component for a size change. (DR-84)

### CPT-03 Name a part Component.part

Name a part with the component name and the part name, for example LeadStory.panel. (DR-84)

### CPT-04 Make a component react to its container

Make a component react to the width of its container, not the viewport. Use the container sizes below. The page layout keeps the viewport breakpoints. (DR-84, DR-86)

### CPT-05 Do not round corners

Do not use rounded corners on images, panels, cards, buttons, inputs or dialogs. Set border-radius to 0. There is no exception (the ThemeToggle switch is removed, DR-349). (DR-87, DR-168, DR-295, DR-349)

### CPT-06 Do not put a border around a card

Do not put a border around a card. Use space, rules and the brand bar to separate content. (DR-87)

### CPT-07 Use tokens and scale classes only

Use only the tokens of the color, typography and layout specs, the component tokens below and the Tailwind 4px scale classes (LAY-21). A value that one component uses is a scale class in that component (gap-7, min-h-13); a token only for a value that two or more components share or that is not a scale step. Do not use arbitrary values (p-[22px]). (LAY-01, LAY-21, DR-223)

A variable that only computes from named tokens is a helper; it needs a code comment naming its sources, not a spec row (DR-437). Examples: `--list-ink-start`, `--divider-item-start`, `--logo-stuck-scale`.

### CPT-08 Do not cut a news title

Do not cut a news title with "…". Let it wrap. (Method)

### CPT-09 Scale insets and overlaps with the container

Give insets and overlaps that follow an image as a share of the container width (cqi) with a minimum and a maximum: clamp(min, n cqi, max). Keep bar thickness, padding and type in fixed tokens. (DR-89)

### CPT-10 Draw the metadata separator

Separate items in a metadata line with a drawn separator: 4px square (no radius), centered on the line, 10px space each side, aria-hidden. The separator takes the text color of its line. Do not type the dot as a character (it sits differently in Bangla and English fonts). No vertical lines or pipes. (DR-98, DR-166)

### CPT-11 Keep the story text hierarchy

Keep the story text hierarchy: title > summary > metadata (> eyebrow is a label, colored, not ranked by size). Each lower level is weaker in at least two of size, weight and color, and is never heavier than the level above. Metadata: weight 400, --color-meta, smaller than the summary. (DR-96)

### CPT-12 Use one metadata size per language

Use one metadata size per language on the whole page: Bangla 15px, English 14px (type-metadata). Do not change the metadata size by component or container size. (DR-101)

### CPT-13 Do not make a section heading a link

Do not make a section heading a link. The heading is plain text (h2). The section link is the আরও দেখুন MoreLink. (DR-122)

### CPT-14 Put one MoreLink at the end of each section

Place one আরও দেখুন MoreLink per section, at the end of the whole section and its end edge. It links to the category page, not to the rail. (DR-123)

### CPT-15 Align a standalone link to the end edge

Align a standalone link (a link on its own line, such as আরও দেখুন or গোপনীয়তা নীতি) to the end edge of its block (text-align: end). Links inside a sentence and title links stay in the text flow. A spec can name an exception. (DR-136)

### CPT-16 Restyle a shadcn component when you add it

Restyle a shadcn/ui component when you add it. After shadcn add, change the file to the Fact Lens sheet before use: remove radius, shadow, dark: classes, opacity modifiers (/50), ring-3, leading-none, text-sm and text-xs, size-4 icons and the active translate. Give the parts the typography roles (typography §7.3) and the color tokens. Keep the behavior (focus, keys, aria). Use Button, Input, Drawer (SearchDialog, from the top), Sheet (Drawer), Collapsible (Drawer.accordion), Tabs (phone region chips), RadioGroup (DailyPoll), Switch (theme controls), Alert (PreferredSourceAlert), Badge (Topics), Card (ContextCard) and Dialog (ShareDialog) (DR-390). Do not use Carousel, NavigationMenu or Separator. Keep the shadcn base-nova preset (Base UI). (DR-236)

### N-01 Name each section with Section at the end

Give each homepage section one component name that ends in Section, for example HeroSection. Its ID is the pattern ID (P-1 to P-5). (DR-162)

### N-02 Name a section by what it holds

Name a section by what it holds, not by its Bangla label or its place on the page. The label is content and can change. (DR-162)

### N-03 Name a one-component part Parent.part

Give a part that only one component uses the name Parent.part, for example OpinionList.item. Write the part in camelCase. (DR-162)

### N-04 Make a shared part its own component

Make a part that two or more components use its own component, with its own C-ID, for example StoryCard. (DR-162)

### N-05 Use the approved names and words

Use the names and words of Section 3 of this document in specs, briefs, canvas boards, code and chat. (DR-162, DR-259)

## 5. Container sizes

A component sets `container-type: inline-size` on its root and reacts to its own width (`CPT-04`). The narrow style is the base. `@container (width >= 600px)` is medium. `@container (width >= 880px)` is wide. The page layout keeps the viewport breakpoints. Some sheets switch at a page breakpoint; the sheet says so.

| Size | Container width | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| narrow | Less than 600px | Phone column, the 304px rail, hero top stories (464px at 1366) |
| medium | 600px to 879px | Tablet lead (720px), lead beside the rail at 1024px (648px) |
| wide | 880px and more | Lead beside the rail from 1280px (904px, 952px) |

## 6. Component tokens

These tokens add to the tokens of the three foundation documents. Put them in `src/styles/components.css` and import it as `spacing-layout-system.md` Section 12.5 lists (DR-339).

| Token | Narrow | Medium | Wide | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--bar-brand` | 6px | 8px | 10px | Thickness of the brand bar on LeadStory | DR-86 |

| `--bar-section` | 2.5rem x 0.5rem (40 x 8px) | 2.5rem x 0.5rem (40 x 8px) | 3rem x 0.5rem (48 x 8px) | Section divider bar, width x height (DR-262). Columns: phone / 600-1023 / 1024 and up (page breakpoints). 48 x 6 under 1024  | DR-103 |

The container rule sets the lead tokens on `.lead-story`, so the `@container` is the parent of `.lead-story`, not the card itself (DR-297). The feature split utilities `story-split-third` and `story-split-feature` and the poll utility `poll-layout` are in `components.css` (DR-297, DR-298).

```

`--color-bar` and `--color-page-title-band` are the two allowed component color tokens (color §2.9, DR-294, DR-349, DR-425); each only points at a color token. The NewsletterSignup colors (after prototype run 2, DR-239) are in `color-system.md` Section 2.9.

Article page tokens (`--rd-*`, `--ad-inline-w`, `--ad-inline-h`) are in `src/styles/reader.css`, scoped under `.rd`. `spacing-layout-system.md` Section 7A lists them (DR-386). The shadcn `Dialog` motion is the `dialog-panel` utility in `components.css` (DR-390).

Load more motion (`spacing-layout-system.md` 7B.2, Latest spec log LT-03): the rows a press adds fade in, and the story image of an added row fades in when it has loaded. Opacity only, the one motion duration (DR-346, DR-284); the base rule removes it with reduced motion (DR-227). In `components.css`:

```css
@keyframes story-added {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

@utility story-added {
  animation: story-added var(--duration-slide) var(--ease-slide);
}

@utility story-image-fade {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity var(--duration-slide) var(--ease-slide);
  &[data-loaded] {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

## 7. Components

### Story units

#### C-01 LeadStory

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-86, DR-87, DR-325

The one lead story of the whole site, in the homepage hero (P-1) only (DR-155). It is the largest story on the page.

**Variants.** None.

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `LeadStory.media` | Image, 16:9, square corners |
| `LeadStory.panel` | Text panel. Background = page color (background). No border |
| `LeadStory.bar` | Brand bar: --bar-brand, --color-bar |
| `LeadStory.eyebrow` | Category: type-eyebrow, interactive (link) |
| `LeadStory.title` | type-story-lead, ink, text-wrap balance, max measure-article-title. News link: hover ink-muted, no pressed color, no underline (COL-06, DR-199) |
| `LeadStory.summary` | Optional. type-summary at weight 500 (DR-97), ink-secondary, max measure-deck |
| `LeadStory.meta` | type-metadata at weight 400 (DR-96), --color-meta |
| Spacing | Eyebrow to title --space-lead-eyebrow-title (8px); title to summary space-story-title-summary (8px); summary to meta --space-lead-summary-meta (16px) |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Image | Full width | Full width | Full width |
| Brand bar | 6px, top of the panel | 8px, top of the panel | 10px, top of the panel |
| Panel | Covers the image by 32px. Starts at the image start edge (left in Bangla and English); 32px of image shows at the end side. Padding 16px top and end, 0 at the start, so text lines up with the image edge | Covers the image by --space-lead-overlap (10% of the card width, min 64px). Inset --space-lead-inset each side (centered, 32px). Padding 24px | Covers the image by --space-lead-overlap (95px at 952). Inset --space-lead-inset (4.2%, max 40px). Padding 32px |
| Title | type-story-lead | Same | Same, capped by measure-article-title |
| Summary, meta | Shown | Shown | Shown |

**Content.**

- Title, eyebrow and meta are required. The summary is optional.
- Image loads eagerly and is preloaded (fetchPriority high): it is the page LCP (DR-325).
- Editors add an image to every hero story (DR-91). If it is missing or does not load, StoryImage shows the no-image placeholder (DR-338).
- Long title: the panel grows down. Do not reduce the type size.

**Accessibility.**

- Title is an h2 with one link to the story. The image link has tabindex -1 and aria-hidden, so the story has one tab stop.
- The eyebrow links to its category page (separate tab stop).
- Text sits on the page color, never on the photo.

**Checks.**

- No border and border-radius 0 at every size.
- Bar thickness and panel padding are fixed per size (they do not scale). Bar is 6px at 360px, 8px at 768px, 10px at 1366px page width; dark theme bar = interactive.
- At 768px and 1366px the panel space to the image edge is equal on both sides (32px, 40px); it never goes under 32px or over 40px.
- Panel covers the image by about 95px at 1366px (952px card) and 72px at 768px (720px card); 32px at 360px, where the panel starts at the image left edge and leaves 32px at the right.
- Panel background equals the page background in both themes.
- One tab stop for the story, one for the eyebrow.

### Story units (shared cards)

#### C-02 OverlapCard

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-91, DR-93, DR-97, DR-98, DR-99, DR-105, DR-106, DR-109, DR-325; `feature` and `eyebrow` (DR-407)

The image-led story card with the text block over the image bottom. Used for the two stories under the lead in the hero (P-1), the first story of the analysis column (P-4) the feature story of the category page (`CategoryFeatureSection`, `feature`) and the 2 x 2 mosaic of the analysis hub (`AnalysisTopSection`, not `feature`, the C-08 `category` Eyebrow; Analysis spec log AN-08). First shared card of the DR-93 merge (DR-106).

**Variants.** surface: background (hero) | elevated (P-4). Sets the text block color to the section background (DR-283). feature: the feature story of a section (category page): the title in type-story-lead, and the body ends with --space-lead-panel, which steps with the card width as in LeadStory (the `.overlap-feature` container rule, Section 6). eyebrow: false drops the Eyebrow when the page title names the category (DR-153).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `OverlapCard.media` | Image, 16:9, square corners (StoryImage). No image: the no-image placeholder (DR-338) |
| `OverlapCard.body` | Text block in the background color of its section (page color in the hero, surface-elevated in P-4), no border. Covers the image bottom by --space-card-overlap from the start edge, stops --space-card-notch short of the end edge |
| `OverlapCard.eyebrow` | Category: type-eyebrow, interactive (link) |
| `OverlapCard.title` | type-story-title (feature: type-story-lead), ink, h3. News link: hover ink-muted, no pressed color, no underline (COL-06, DR-199) |
| `OverlapCard.summary` | Optional. type-summary at weight 500 (DR-97), ink-secondary |
| `OverlapCard.meta` | type-metadata at weight 400 (DR-96), --color-meta |
| Spacing | Same gaps as LeadStory: 8 / 8 / 16px (DR-92) |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body | Same look as every width: overlap and notch 40px at 328 (DR-109, replaces DR-94) | Covers the image by --space-card-overlap (10% of card width, 46px at 464); --space-card-notch (10%) of image shows at the end side; padding 16px top and end, 0 at the start (DR-105) | Same |
| Title | type-story-title | Same | Same |
| Place | Phone: stacked under the lead. 768: pair, 348px each. 1024: pair, 312px. 1366: pair, 464px. Category page: one feature card, the wrapper width |  |  |

**Content.**

- Editors add an image (DR-91). If it is missing or does not load, StoryImage shows the no-image placeholder (DR-338).
- In the hero, both top-story images load eagerly (DR-325).
- Long title: the body grows down.
- In the pair, each card flows on its own: no shared rows (no subgrid) for title, summary or meta; the cards are top-aligned and may end at different heights (DR-99). This replaces layout L-14 / LAY-08 peer rows for the hero pair.

**Accessibility.**

- Title is an h3 with one link. Image link has tabindex -1 and aria-hidden.

**Checks.**

- No border and border-radius 0.
- Body covers the image by --space-card-overlap and leaves --space-card-notch of image at the end side (46px each on a 464px card, 40px on a 328px card).

#### C-03 StoryList

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-93, DR-96, DR-98, DR-101, DR-102, DR-124, DR-125, DR-300, DR-350

Shared list (DR-162, was LatestList): a ul of story items with 16px padding and a 1px rule between rows, no rule after the last. Option columns 1 | 2 (column-first). This sheet gives its first use, HeroSection.latest: the সর্বশেষ (Latest) list in the hero rail (P-1), 5 newest stories as StoryListItem rows. Also used in P-2, P-4, CategoryBlock and RegionSlider.panel.

**Variants.** None.

Built with CSS columns and a column break before item 4, so each column keeps its own row heights. Divider.column-inset between the two columns, centered in the gap (DR-355) | Rail 304px from 1024: 1 column, rows stack |
| Title | type-story-title-sm (18 to 20px) | Same | Same |

#### C-24 StoryCard

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-93, DR-108, DR-118, DR-119, DR-121, DR-126, DR-152, DR-153, DR-267, DR-283, DR-300, DR-308, DR-325; layout dated: DR-406

Shared card from the merge (DR-93): one story with an image and text. Draws every image story that is not a LeadStory or an OverlapCard. Takes over the working name StoryRow (DR-121). Merge approved (DR-153): no approved look changes.

**Variants.** layout: stack | row | row-from-md | row-until-lg | dated (the section sets it; a layout value changes only the grid, never the markup order, DR-283). ratio: 3:2 | 16:9. size: lead (type-story-lead, the analysis hub hero; Analysis spec log AN-06) | md (type-story-title) | sm (type-story-title-sm, 18 to 20px). split, row only: third (2fr 1fr, DR-108) | feature (DR-118, DR-119 clamp); both use --grid-column-gap between text and image (DR-300). The analysis hub hero adds `story-split-lead` to the feature split: text : image = 1 : 2, no image cap (Analysis spec log AN-04, AN-05). eyebrow and summary optional.

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `StoryCard.media` | Image, ratio prop, square corners, grid area media. Link with tabindex -1 and aria-hidden |
| `StoryCard.body` | Grid area body. Markup order follows LAY-14: stack has media then body; row has media then body in the DOM and the grid places the image at the end (DR-267). Eyebrow (optional), title h3, summary (optional, 500), meta. Title: News link: hover ink-muted, no pressed color, no underline (COL-06, DR-199) |
| Spacing | stack: media, 16px, body. Eyebrow to title 8px; title to summary 8px; summary to meta 16px; title to meta 8px when no summary |
| `StoryCard.date` | dated only: the meta line in its own grid area, the time only (no reading time). Under 600px: media, space-story-media-text, body, space-lead-summary-meta, date. From 600px: three columns, date (8rem) \| body \| media, body : media = 2 : 1, --grid-column-gap between them, all three top-aligned. Stacks as under 600px when the card is narrower than 17.5rem (DR-308) |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |

| row | P-2 rail image story when the rail stacks, phones too (16:9, sm, third, DR-121) | P-4 AnalysisSection compact rows (16:9, sm, eyebrow, third) | P-2 featureStory from 768 (3:2, md, summary, feature) |
| dated | Category page More stories, stacked (16:9, md, summary, no eyebrow; an analysis story shows the C-08 `format` Eyebrow above the title, `formatLabel`, DR-415). With the Eyebrow on (Latest: `category`; topic page: `format`), the row shows that one Eyebrow and no second format label (Topic spec log TP-04) | Same, three columns from 600 | Same |

**Content.**

- Editors add an image. If it is missing or does not load, StoryImage shows the no-image placeholder (DR-338).
- Long titles wrap; no clamp.

**Accessibility.**

- Each story is an article with an h3 title link; one tab stop per story.
- Markup order = reading order (LAY-14, DR-267): the image comes before the text in the markup at every layout; in row layout grid areas place the image at the end (no order property).

**Checks.**

- No radius, no card border.
- Every row layout stacks (image on top, text below) when its container is narrower than 17.5rem (@container, rem-based): at 200% text the rows below 1280 stack; at normal text no row stacks. Check the value in the build (A11Y-18, DR-308).
- Image loads lazily, except the hero cards (DR-325).
- `imageFadeIn` (off by default): the image stays transparent over the `surface-alt` slot fill until it has loaded, then fades in (`story-image-fade`). Only the rows a load more press adds use it (spacing-layout 7B.2, Latest spec log LT-03).
- The list around the card draws rules and padding, not the card.
- Each place matches its approved board.

`eyebrowMode` (optional): the C-08 Eyebrow in that mode above the title, `--space-lead-eyebrow-title` to the title; none when unset. The homepage region columns set `format` (DR-433, amended 30 Oct 2026); every other list leaves it unset.

**Variants.** None. The meta content changes by place (category and time in Latest; time and read time elsewhere).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `StoryListItem.title` | type-story-title-sm (18 to 20px, 600), ink, h3 with one link. News link: hover ink-muted, no pressed color, no underline (COL-06, DR-199) |
| `StoryListItem.meta` | type-metadata, 400, --color-meta, 8px below the title (CPT-10, CPT-12) |
| List | The parent list (ul / ol) gives 16px padding top and bottom and the 1px rule between rows (C-22 item); no rule after the last row |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Used in | HeroSection.latest, P-2 rail | C-23 CategoryBlock | RegionSlider.panel |

**Content.**

| Rail image story | Row: text left, image right, 2 : 1 (DR-121) | Row: text left, image right, 2 : 1 | 304 rail beside: image on top, text below  |

**Content.**

The opinion column (right) of বিশ্লেষণ ও মতামত (P-4): a মতামত chip, then 5 opinion pieces as quote rows. The quote rows are the part `OpinionRows`; the category page Opinion block (C-23, DR-415) uses them under its own heading, without the chip.

**Variants.** None.

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Chip | মতামত: brand fill (light), interactive fill (dark), on-interactive text, type-eyebrow, padding 2px 8px, square corners. Not a link. Replaces the spec accent-subtle chip (DR-112, issue CLR-09) |

#### C-23 CategoryBlock

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-53, DR-93, DR-101, DR-103, DR-110, DR-122, DR-123, DR-126, DR-127, DR-128, DR-134, DR-138, DR-139, DR-152, DR-239, DR-240, DR-245, DR-351; category page use: DR-415 (category formats spec log CF-03)

One category inside the grouped categories section (P-3): heading, a feature story with image, 2 text rows and আরও দেখুন. Rows of two blocks, an ad-inset between rows, a rail with DailyPoll (C-26). NewsletterSignup (C-14) joins the rail after prototype run 2 (DR-239).

**Variants.** None. The section grid switches columns at the page breakpoints: 2 blocks per row from 600, 1 on phones.

**On the category page** (`CategoryFormatsSection`, DR-415). The page gives each block its heading, its name (the `category-<name>` id) and its MoreLink target; on the homepage these are the category name, the category id and the category page, so P-3 does not change (DR-370). Two blocks in one row: বিশ্লেষণ / Analysis at the start, মতামত / Opinion at the end, up to 5 stories each. The Analysis block has the featureStory and the rows; the Opinion block replaces them with the `OpinionRows` of C-06 (no image). No ad-inset and no rail content: the blocks are in the wrapper, the rail column is empty. An empty block is not shown and the other keeps its size (layout 7.3).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Heading | Section divider (C-22) + category name, h2, plain text, not a link (DR-122) |

| Rows | Two text rows: title type-story-title-sm + meta, 16px padding, rule between (StoryList, as in P-2 and the hero). 3 stories per category (DR-126) |
| MoreLink | আরও দেখুন links to the category page, at the block end edge, pinned to the block bottom so both blocks in a row line up (DR-110, DR-123). In `CategoryFormatsSection` it links to the format hub, `/analysis` or `/opinion` |
| ad-inset | Between the two rows of blocks, wrapper width, surface-alt, label বিজ্ঞাপন on a 24px line. 728 x 90 from 1280, 300 x 250 below, phones too. Never after the last row. Space-module above and below belongs to the section |
| Rail | Daily poll in prototype run 2 (DR-239), then from 1280 the ad-rail slot space-module below it: 300×600 or 300×250, reserve 600 (DR-240 to DR-245). No section divider: plain h2 (DR-128), type-section-title 22px (DR-215). At the top of the 304px rail beside the wrapper from 1024; a full row below the blocks under 1024. After run 2 the newsletter sits above the poll, 64px apart beside the wrapper, 48px when the rail stacks (DR-150) |

| Blocks | Phone: 1 column, A, B, ad, C, D, then the poll | 600 to 1023: 2 per row (264px at 600, 348px at 768), rail below: the poll as a full row (DR-134, DR-239) | 1024 and up: 2 per row (312px at 1024, 440px at 1280), rail 304 beside |
| ad-inset | 300 x 250 | 300 x 250 | 300 x 250 at 1024 to 1279, 728 x 90 from 1280 |

**Content.**

- 4 categories in wireframe V2 (অর্থনীতি ও বাণিজ্য, নিরাপত্তা ও সংঘাত, প্রযুক্তি, ইতিহাস ও প্রেক্ষাপট). Odd count: the last block keeps its size (layout §7.3).
- Lead story: editors add an image. If it is missing or does not load, StoryImage shows the no-image placeholder (DR-338).
- Long titles wrap; no clamp.

**Accessibility.**

- h2 per category; each story is an article with an h3 link. Poll: radiogroup, vote button, results in role=status.

**Checks.**

- No radius on cards, fields or buttons. No card borders.
- The poll never uses the ad label or ad colors.
- Poll: square marker, no round radio dots (DR-138).

#### C-07 RankedList

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-44, DR-148, DR-290, DR-300, DR-403, DR-404 (category spec log CL-18, CL-21, CL-22); one layout on the homepage and the category page (IMP-99, most read spec log HM-01 to HM-03; amends DR-51, DR-145, DR-299, DR-144, DR-146, DR-147)

Most read (P-5): the 5 most read stories as a numbered list. RankedList.item = rank chip + title (DR-162, was RankItem). One layout on the homepage and the category page (the former `columns` variant; the `grid` layout is removed).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Heading | Section divider (C-22) + সর্বাধিক পঠিত / Most read, h2, not a link, SectionHeading across the shell. No section link (no page behind it) |
| List | ol, 5 items, column-first in CSS columns: items 1 to 3 in the first list column, 4 and 5 in the second, which starts with a column break and no space above, so the column tops line up. Column gap --grid-column-gap (16px under 768, 24px from 768, 32px from 1280, DR-300). No Divider.item: the items are --rank-list-gap apart (amends DR-299) |
| Rank | A square chip, --rank-chip-size, in --color-bar with on-interactive digits, as the label Chip (C-11). Serif digits in both languages (Source Serif 4, Noto Serif Bengali), --rank-chip-digit-size at --rank-chip-digit-weight. The inner span takes off --rank-chip-ink-start and --rank-chip-ink-end, so the chip centers the ink of the digits. 16px to the title. The chip and the whole title center on each other. The rank comes from the data (backend query): React writes it in a span with aria-hidden="true", digits in the page language (১ on Bangla pages, 1 on English pages). No CSS counter (DR-290). CSS: `@utility rank-list` (Section 6). Replaces `type-rank` (amends DR-144, DR-146, DR-147) |
| Title | h3 link, type-story-title-sm 600, ink. No image, no meta. News link: hover ink-muted, no pressed color, no underline (COL-06, DR-199) |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Columns | Phone: 1 | 600 to 1023: 2 list columns across the shell | From 1024: a 3-column grid (--grid-column-gap); the start column stays empty, the list spans the middle and end columns |

**Content.**

- Always 5 stories.
- Long titles wrap; no clamp.
- An ad band follows the section.

**Accessibility.**

- The list order gives the rank; the chip is hidden from screen readers.

**Checks.**

- The tops of the two list columns line up.
- The chip digits are centered in the chip.
- No rule between items, no radius, no card borders.
- At 200% browser text size the list stacks and nothing scrolls sideways (DR-81).

### Section parts

#### C-15 RegionSlider

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-19, DR-140, DR-141, DR-142, DR-143, DR-151, DR-227, DR-236, DR-284, DR-291, DR-318, DR-433 (amended 30 Oct 2026)

The regions section (P-3b): one column per region in a row that slides, previous / next buttons at the heading end; chips (tabs) on phones.

**Variants.** Slider (600 and up) and chips with one panel (phones).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Heading | Section divider (C-22) + অঞ্চলসমূহ, h2, not a link (DR-159) |
| Buttons | Previous / next at the end of the heading line, 44px squares, interactive fill, on-interactive chevron. Shown whenever more regions exist than are in view (DR-140); CSS hides them when every region fits, no script count (DR-318). At an end: aria-disabled, surface-alt fill, ink-disabled chevron |
| `RegionSlider.panel` | Region name h3 type-story-title-sm, 3:2 image, 3 stories (C-08 Eyebrow in `format` mode, title type-story-title-sm + meta), rules between. The Eyebrow: the category on news, বিশ্লেষণ / Analysis on analysis (DR-433, amended by tajmin 30 Oct 2026). No আরও দেখুন per column |
| Section link | আরও দেখুন at the section end, end edge, every width; links to the regions page (DR-142, DR-160) |
| Chips | Phones only: shadcn Tabs (CPT-16): Tabs, TabsList and TabsTab only; the panels are the slider columns, not Tabs.Panel, which hides them from 600 (DR-348), tabs 44px, as wide as the label, 8px gap, outline (1px border-interactive, no fill); selected = interactive fill; no white chips (DR-140). One panel, h3 visually hidden |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In view | Phone: chips, 1 region | 600 to 1023: 2 (DR-141) | 3 at 1024 to 1279 (DR-141), 4 from 1280 (DR-140) |

**Content.**

- Working list of 8 regions (DR-411; see Section 8). Labels approved by tajmin, 28 Oct 2026; the backend owns the list and the order. A region with no stories does not show.
- Long titles wrap; no clamp.

**Accessibility.**

- Buttons are real buttons with aria-label (আগের অঞ্চল / পরের অঞ্চল); focus stays on a disabled-at-end button.
- Phones: tablist, tab, tabpanel.

**Checks.**

- Own slider code, not the shadcn Carousel (CPT-16): its disabled ends and motion differ from DR-140 and DR-151.
- The row is a scroll-snap container (@utility region-row, layout §12.3). One press moves one region: the buttons animate the scroll position one column over --duration-slide (450ms) with ease-slide (cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1), DR-227, DR-284); no transform. Swipe and keyboard focus scroll the row natively. Button colors fade 200ms (theme default). Phones: a chip press fades the current tab panel out and the new panel in, each --duration-slide (450ms), ease-slide, opacity only (DR-284, DR-346: one motion duration). No motion with prefers-reduced-motion (DR-151). No loop, no autoplay; scrollbar hidden.
- No radius on buttons or chips.
- The slider is the exception to LAY-07 (4 columns from 1280, layout P-3b).

**Content.**

- Never sticky. top: Phase 1 leaves the band out when no campaign is booked (DR-250); a booked top never collapses; the Phase 2 house ad is ADS-09. band and inset collapse only when unfilled before they near the viewport.

**Accessibility.**

- Not a landmark: a div, no section element and no aria-label. The visible label বিজ্ঞাপন names the slot and is not aria-hidden (DR-266).

**Checks.**

- No padding or gutter.
- Height reserved before load (no layout shift).

#### C-14 NewsletterSignup

**Status:** Deferred · **Decisions:** DR-128, DR-129, DR-130, DR-131, DR-132, DR-133, DR-134, DR-135, DR-137, DR-224, DR-229, DR-230, DR-231, DR-238, DR-239

Paused for prototype run 2: not built or shown; it comes in a phase after run 2 (DR-239). The approved look below stays the spec for that phase. Newsletter invitation in the P-3 rail (304px) or as a full row under 1024. Own solid surface; never the news look or the ad look.

**Variants.** layout rail | row (600 to 1023: heading on top, line left, form right, DR-135).

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `NewsletterSignup.panel` | accent-soft in both themes (light #EDCEC4, dark #3A201A, DR-229). panel-inset (LAY-20): 40 / 32px in a container under 600px (rail, phones), 48 / 40px from 600px (row) (DR-224) |

- Not surface-alt (ad look).
- Light border-interactive on accent-soft is 3.14:1 (color §3, DR-238).

#### C-26 DailyPoll

Daily poll in the P-3 rail: at the top of the rail from 1024 (the only rail module in prototype run 2, DR-239; NewsletterSignup sits above it after run 2); full row under 1024.

**Variants.** state choose | results. layout rail | row.

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `DailyPoll.section` | No panel: no background, padding, border, radius or shadow. The poll sits on background like every section. No section divider, no brand bar, no rule (DR-128, DR-273) |
| `DailyPoll.heading` | আজকের জরিপ (Daily poll), h2, type-section-title 22px, ink (DR-215). 16px to the question |
| `DailyPoll.question` | fieldset (border 0, padding 0, margin 0, min-width 0) with the question as legend: type-story-title-sm 20px, ink. 24px to the first option or the first result row (DR-149) |
| `DailyPoll.options` | Choose state. shadcn RadioGroup (CPT-16). 2 to 4 label rows; the whole row is the tap target: flex, align center, gap 12px, min-height 48px, 4px apart. Label type-ui, ink; long labels wrap. No option selected at first. 24px to the button |
| `DailyPoll.marker` | 20px square, no radius, 2px border, aria-hidden. Not selected: border-interactive, no fill. Selected: interactive border with a 12px interactive square inside, inset 2px (padding 2px). Not a full fill (DR-273) |
| `DailyPoll.vote` | Button primary, full width, 48px, no radius: ভোট দিন (Vote) (DR-208). Hover interactive-hover, pressed interactive-pressed. Enabled with no option selected; a press with no choice does nothing and focus stays where it is (DR-348) |
| `DailyPoll.results` | Results state, in role status; replaces the choose state in place, no page reload. No radio and no marker. Per option: label line (type-ui, ink; the own vote adds " · আপনার ভোট" / " · Your vote" in the same style), 8px, then the bar. 16px between rows |
| `DailyPoll.bar` | 32px high, full width, no radius, aria-hidden. Track: border token. Fill from the start edge, width = the rounded percent: own vote interactive, others fill-neutral (#7E7E7E) in both themes (color token, DR-295; 2.72:1 / 2.68:1 on the track, accepted because the percent carries the value) (DR-273) |
| `DailyPoll.percent` | Inside the track at the end edge, 8px in, vertically centered: type-ui-sm, tabular-nums, digits in the page language (৪৬%). Color ink; it switches to the background color when the fill reaches the start of the number (fill end >= track width - 8px - number width; near 85% in the 304 rail, so measure, do not hard-code 85). Switch the whole number, not part of it. Hard to read over the grey fill is accepted (DR-273) |

**Content.**

- 2 to 4 options; long options wrap.

**Accessibility.**

- The shadcn RadioGroup sits in a fieldset; the question is its legend and names the group (no aria-labelledby, DR-273, DR-298).
- Keys: Tab enters the group, arrow keys move the choice, Space selects, Tab reaches the vote button.
- Focus: the base 2px ring outline with 2px offset (COL-13, DR-225); no focus classes, no ring utilities.
- After a vote the vote button is gone: focus moves to the poll heading h2 (tabindex -1, DR-346). Results in role status, so the change is announced. Markers and bars are aria-hidden; the text gives the label, the own-vote tag and the percent.

**Checks.**

- No panel, no radius, no helper lines (DR-138, DR-273).
- The choose and results states share one grid cell, so the height does not jump (DR-287, DR-348). Before the vote a hidden copy of the results (inert, aria-hidden, invisible) holds the cell height.
- One vote per browser, kept in local storage (key fl-poll:<id>, DR-277). A vote cannot be changed. A return visit with a stored vote for the poll shows the results.
- Percents by largest remainder, so the sum is 100 (CMP-29, DR-277). Mock data until M3.

### Small parts

#### C-22 Divider

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-87, DR-102, DR-103, DR-262, DR-299, DR-350, DR-351; Divider.rule: DR-405

A thin rule that separates list rows, sections, modules and (option) columns. Dividers and space show grouping; no card borders or surfaces for that (DR-87).

**Variants.** section, item, rule, column-inset, column-full (DR-262; rule: tajmin, 27 Oct 2026). DR-351 sets where column-inset is used (Divider.column); column-full is not used on the homepage: its one place is the analysis hub mosaic (Analysis spec log AN-10). The canvas drawings are stale until the CMP-34 redraw.

| Part | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| `Divider.item` | 1px dotted rule, border color: square 1 x 1px dots with a 2px gap in every browser (DR-351). Draw it with a repeating gradient, not border-style dotted (browsers differ): background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, var(--color-border) 0 1px, transparent 1px 3px); height 1px. Full width of the list, except OpinionList: the text column only (DR-351). 16px space each side (space-list-item), measured to the text ink, not the line box (DR-350): the list takes the ink inset of its roles off its padding (typography §3.1, DR-355). Check: per list, the median space is 16px ±1; each rule is 16px ±3 (the ink depends on the letters, DR-355). Between rows only; no rule after the last row |
| `Divider.section` | 2px solid rule, border color. A bar sits on the rule at the start and shares its bottom edge (the rule runs along the bar bottom). Bar color: brand (light), interactive (dark). Bar size: --bar-section. 12px from the rule to the heading (space-section-rule-title) |
| `Divider.rule` | 1px solid horizontal rule, border color (--divider-rule), the full width of its container. The shared part wherever one plain 1px rule is needed: not between list rows (Divider.item) and not under a section heading (Divider.section). The space on each side belongs to the caller and is the same on both sides. A component, `<Divider variant="rule" />`, aria-hidden. Used on the category page above load more (`spacing-layout-system.md` 7B). To move to it: the article page rule above the Topics, and the other hand-drawn rules in IMP-100 |
| `Divider.column` | 1px solid vertical rule, border color, centered in the column gap. Two versions: column-inset (16px from the top and bottom) and column-full (full height). Placed (DR-351, DR-355): column-inset in P-4 between analysis and opinion (from 768), in P-3 between the wrapper and the rail (from 1024), and between the two HeroSection.latest columns (768 to 1023). Always centered in the gap; no pixel split. column-full is not used on the homepage; it is placed between the wrapper and the rail of the analysis hub mosaic (from 1024, `divider-column-rail-full`, Section 6; Analysis spec log AN-10) |

| Part | Phone or narrow | Tablet or medium | Desktop or wide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item | Same | Same | Same |
| Section bar | 40 x 8px (under 600) | 40 x 8px (600 to 1023) | 48 x 8px (1024 and up) |
| Column | Not shown: columns stack | Where a section sheet places it, when columns sit side by side | Same |

**Content.**

- One color (border). Section rule 2px solid; item rule 1px dotted; rule 1px solid; column rule 1px solid. No dashed or double rules.
- Do not draw a 1px horizontal rule by hand (a border or a 1px div): use Divider.rule.
- General rule (DR-299): a group of items of the same kind stacked in a column gets Divider.item between the items (StoryList, OpinionList, the AnalysisSection rows, RegionSlider.panel). In a multi-column list the rule runs within a column only (DR-300). RankedList has no rule: its items are --rank-list-gap apart (C-07, IMP-99).

**Accessibility.**

- Decorative: aria-hidden or CSS border. Lists keep ul/li semantics; do not use hr between list items.

**Checks.**

- No other border color or width.
- No rule after the last list item.

#### C-13 SectionHeading

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-103, DR-122, DR-159, DR-163, DR-262

The heading of every news and category section: the section divider (C-22) with the bar on the rule, then the section name as plain text (h2). Optional actions slot at the end edge (slider buttons, C-15). Rail modules (NewsletterSignup, DailyPoll) do not use it (DR-128).

| Title | 22px | Same | Same |

**Content.**

- The label is content and can change (N-02). Long labels wrap; no clamp.

**Accessibility.**

- One h2 per section. The section element is labelled by the h2 (aria-labelledby).
- The rule and bar are decorative.

**Checks.**

- Heading is not a link.
- Bar and rule share the bottom edge.
- No other heading size inside the component.

#### C-43 PageTitle

**Status:** Approved · **Decisions:** DR-405 (category page spec log CL-14), DR-415 (category-formats spec log CF-06), DR-424, DR-425 (xc-fixes spec log XF-01)

The title of a page that is not the homepage or an article: the page `h1` in a band. The category page uses it with the category name (`spacing-layout-system.md` 7B). Code: `src/components/layout/PageTitle.tsx`.

**Variants.** None. Every page that has a PageTitle shows the band.

| `PageTitle.band` | A `header`. The background is `--color-page-title-band` (`surface` in light and dark, `color-system.md` 2.9), class `bg-(--color-page-title-band)`; it spans the full width; the content sits in the `Shell`, so it lines up with the page. Block inset `--space-page-title-band` (24px narrow, 32px from 600px, 40px from 1024px), no inline inset (tajmin, 28 Oct 2026).

The sticky bar at the top of every page. The top ad band is below the NavBar (below the TopBar under 1280), not above the TopBar (DR-295). Full page width with the page gutter (not the shell). Three groups: menu (and search from 768) at the start, logo in the center, language and theme at the end (DR-170).

**Variants.** None. Contents change at the page breakpoints 768 and 1024.

When the bar is stuck: 24px (20px phones). The bar height does not change; the logo scales down with a transform (zoom out), --duration-slide (450ms) ease-slide, so the page does not move (DR-295, DR-349). No motion with reduced motion |
| `TopBar.language` | Text link, type-ui-sm weight 600 (typography §7; the size follows the link lang, DR-359), ink, 32px tall under 768, 36px from 768, the same as the icon buttons (DR-349).

| Layout | Flex row, full page width, padding --top-bar-inset (page gutter minus the controls inner space, DR-294). Start and end groups flex: 1 1 0, logo group auto, so the logo stays centered.

| Surface | background (page color), 1px border rule at the bottom when the bar is stuck, both themes, every width (DR-295). Under 1280 the NavBar is hidden, so the bar is stuck once the page scrolls (DR-348), no shadow. Height --bar-height 56px, 64px from 1024. The site header (TopBar and, from 1280, the NavBar) is sticky at every width: sticky top-0 z-(--z-bar) (DR-234, DR-265, DR-349). Stuck state: past the NavBar the html gets data-bar-stuck; the NavBar slides up under the TopBar and the logo scales (C-18, DR-349); the TopBar shows its rule through the bar-stuck variant in components.css (DR-287) |
| SkipLink | The first focusable element of the page, before the top ad band. Hidden until it gets focus, then shown at the page start with the base focus outline. Text মূল খবরে যান / Skip to main content. Target <main id="main" tabindex="-1"> (the hero; tabindex so Safari moves focus). scroll-padding-top keeps the sticky bar off the target (DR-269) |
